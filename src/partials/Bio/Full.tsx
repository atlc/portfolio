                Hey there, I'm Andrew, a Birmingham native who's passionate about all aspects of software development. I really enjoy problem-solving and find
                development to be a wonderfully creative field. I usually develop in the TypeScript+React+Node.js realm but will venture out into some C++ for
                Arduino projects, especially for Halloween costume contests (ask me about those!), or Python from time to time. I'm currently learning Rust with
                a great little book called "Command-Line Rust," which teaches you to recreate some common Unix utilities. It's a lot of fun so far! Speaking of
                *nix, I'm a long-time Linux proponent, having used it for almost half my life now. While I used to be an avid distro-hopper, these days I mostly
                stick around in the Debian/Ubuntu family.

                Beyond my technical background, I'm deeply passionate about mentoring and helping grow the next generation of developers. Having spent nearly
                four years teaching software development at a programming bootcamp, I've had the privilege of helping countless aspiring developers unlock their
                potential and embark on their own journeys in tech. It has been very rewarding seeing students coming in with virtually zero programming
                knowledge become very accomplished developers who go on to build some very awesome things.

            <h4>
                Outside of software development, I enjoy gardening, particularly with native wildflowers, cooking, woodworking, hiking, and basically anything
                outdoors! I also love hanging out with my dog, Lucy, and my three cats, Lunatic, Scout, and Kitchen.{" "}
