                Hey there, I'm Andrew, a Birmingham native who's passionate about software development. I thrive on problem-solving and love the creativity
                inherent in development.

                While I mainly work with TypeScript, React, and Node.js, I also enjoy working with Arduino projects (
                <em>ask me about my Halloween costumes!</em>). I'm currently learning Rust through a stellar book "Command-Line Rust", teaching how to recreate
                some common Unix CLI tools. I'm also a big Linux fan, having been a user now for almost half my life!
            </h4>
            <h4>Besides coding, I'm very passionate about mentoring, having spent nearly four years turning students into software developers.</h4>
            <h4>Outside of tech, I enjoy gardening, cooking, woodworking, hiking, and spending time with my pets: Lucy, Lunatic, Scout, and Kitchen.</h4>
