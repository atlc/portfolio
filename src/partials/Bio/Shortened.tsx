                Hey there, I'm Andrew, a Birmingham native deeply passionate about software development. I thrive on problem-solving and love the creativity
                inherent in development.

            <h4>
                While I mainly work with TypeScript, React, and Node.js, I also enjoy exploring C++ for Arduino projects and Python for various tasks. Currently
                delving into Rust through "Command-Line Rust," I've been a Linux advocate for almost half my life.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                Besides coding, I'm dedicated to mentoring, with nearly four years of experience teaching software development. I find it incredibly fulfilling
                to guide aspiring developers on their journey.

            <h4>Outside of tech, I enjoy gardening, cooking, woodworking, hiking, and spending time with my pets: Lucy, Lunatic, Scout, and Kitchen.</h4>
